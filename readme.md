## The most font

This is a project to explore the similarties and differences in font design and to find the most representative font (i.e., the most averagely designed).

The project is primarily done in Processing, but includes a helper bash script (to use ImageMagick). The project includes the following (and should be run in this order):

A. Calculate bounding boxes
B. Generate black and white font-letter maps
C. Generate overlay letter maps
D. Generate transparent font-letter maps
E. Calculate overlap
